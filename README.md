# neural-net-function-solver
TensorFlow-based neural net optimized to solve functions of two variables, z = f(x, y).  Model can be trained on an experimental dataset, where the function is unknown, or from data generated directly from an input function.

Example:

![Example f(x, y) = cos(r), where r = sqrt(x**2 + y**2)](https://Example%20output.png)
